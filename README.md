Mongo DB homework

Overall Comment: This was an interesting assignment and I was somewhat getting the hang of Mongo scripting by the end of it! I work in the field of Finance so I think it's likely that I'll be dealing with structured data as opposed to unstructured data, however learning the foundational data skills in Mongo will undoubtly give me an advantage if I encounter unstructured data in my future! 

Note on the files: In the 'NoSQL_setup_starter_Final' file, I wrote code that will import the JSON file from within the Jupyter Notebook file. This wasn't taught in class, however a tutor showed me how to do it when i asked if it was possible. This code needs to run FIRST before running the file to import the data, and should not be run again. Finally, the second file 'No_SQL_analysis_starter' depends on the first file successfully importing the data (because it's saved in the MongoDB on the terminal).

2. Convert string to number: https://www.mongodb.com/community/forums/t/convert-string-to-number/107531/5, accessed 8/22/23. Note: I found this helpful in writing the code to convert strings to numbers in Mongo.
